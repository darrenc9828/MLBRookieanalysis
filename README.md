# MLBRookieanalysis
In this project I will be collecting rookie batting averages for a given year. Comparing them to their fifth year to see how well they have performed since their rookie year. This project is an ongoing learning project that will be built on as I learn different things using pandas and other libraries installed.

##                                      Getting the Program to Run:
1. Confirm that a version of Python 3 has been installed on your local machine

2. Use Git Bash and navigate to where you would like the cloned repository using CD'command(the desired path)

3. Clone the repo from github.

4. To make sure you have all necessary packages to run the program you will need to read the requirments.txt file in the repo.

5. Once repo is cloned, use File Explorer to navigate to the directory folder that contains the repo.

6. Once you have navigated to the folder, from the file path line type "cmd" to bring up the command prompt in that directory.

7. From the command line, run "jupyter notebook", this will open a browser window.

8. From the browser window open "MLBrookieanalysis.ipynb", run this to run the program.

9. Once you have opened the file click "Run All' on the top of the notebook.


## Requirements
                                     Requirements met for this project:

Requiremnets are from the project requirements list from Code Kentucky list of requirements for Data analysis part 1:

1. Read in data: Project consisted of two csv files that used the pandas function in the pandas python package to read the files.
2. Manipulate and clean the data:  Used in built-pandas and numpy functions to remove such things as NAN values in the data.
3. Analize the data: Used functions to create new DataFrames, merging DataFrames, sorted out other columns and rows.
4. Visulize the data: Make simple basic plots with matplotlib. (I'm still working on this...)
5: Interpret data and graphical output.
 
 All work in this repo has been done by the owner Darren Caldwell (Stutdent trying to figure it all out this last three months for the first time.)
