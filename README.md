# MLBRookieanalysis
In this project I will be collecting rookie batting averages for a given year. Comparing them to their fifth year to see how well they have performed since their rookie year. Some questions I would like to answer would be 1) did they improve as experience was gained.

Getting the Program to Run:
1) Confirm that a version of Python 3 has been installed on your local machine
2)Use Git Bash and navigate to where you would like the cloned repository using CD'command(the desired path)
3) Clone the repo from github.
4)To make sure you have all necessary packages to run the program you will need to read the requirments.txt file in the repo.
5 )Once repo is cloned, use File Explorer to navigate to the directory folder that contains the repo.
6) Once you have navigated to the folder, from the file path line type "cmd" to bring up the command prompt in that directory.
7) From the command line, run "jupyter notebook", this will open a browser window.
8) From the browser window open "MLBrookieanalysis.ipynb", run this to run the program.
