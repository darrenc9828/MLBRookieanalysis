# MLBRookieanalysis
In this project I wil be collecting rookie batting averages for a given year.  Comparing them for five years to see how well they have performed since their rookie year.
Some questions I would like to answer would be 1) did they improve as experience was gained, 2) Did injury cause a decrease in average, and 3) is their salary compariable to their perfomance.
